This will be the first Miami Open final between two Top 5 players since Serena Williams knocked off Li Na in 2014, and this one will be filled with excitement as these players get reacquainted with one another.

Sabalenka has reached the finals in both the Australian Open and Indian Wells but has finished runner-up both times. This time feels different after dominating Miami, not losing a set all tournament.

Meanwhile, Pegula will look for some revenge after falling to Sabalennka in the Cincinnati and US Open finals, a win would help her climb to World No. 3. She has had a tougher road to the final, with three of her five matches going the distance. That endurance and grit just might be what she needs to take down Sabalenka in the final.
